# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is used to optimize by using more storage.
Mostly Dynamic programming is used where recursion is used.

**When we can use dynamic programming ?**
1. When we have choice
2. When we have to optimize like largest,smallest,minimum,maximum etc.

We can achieve DP by two ways:
1. Memoization (Bottom-UP ) approach using recursion
2. Top Down approach
 

Before DP we have to understand recursion

### Recursion
How to write recursion base case ?

We have to find the smallest valid value which can be for our question. That would be our base case.

Firstly we will write **Recursive code -> Memoization -> Top Down (optional)**

**How to make matrix for DP ?**
We have to find which constraint is changing its value in recursive code. It can be two different values also.
Ex : In fibonacci n is decreased in recursive call. So we will make 2D matrix size.

# Most Popular Problems of DP

**1. 01 Knapsack Problem : **

**Problem statement : **
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

**Recursive Approach :**

**Function Definition :**
```C++
int knapsack(int wt[],int val[],int W,int n)
{
}
```

**Structure of recursion code : **
int knapsack(int wt[],int val[],int W,int n)
{
	Base Case
	Choice Diagram
}

Base Condition :
**Base Condition -> Think of the smallest valid Input**
So smallest valid input will be n=0 and W=0 and it will return 0 because profit will be 0.

**Code:**
```C++
int knapsack(int wt[],int val[],int W,int n)
{
 if(n==0 || W==0)
 	return 0;
 if(wt[n-1]<=W)
 	return max(val[n-1]+knapsack(wt,val,W-wt[n-1],n-1),knapsack(wt,val,W,n-1));
 else if(wt[n-1]>W)
 	return knapsack(wt,val,W,n-1);
}
```



**Memoization Approach : **
This is one of the DP approach. In this we will make 2D matrix. 
Memoization -> Recursive approach + 3 lines

**What will be the	 size of matrix ?**
Basically how many input we have ? 
wt[],val[],W,n
And all of these how many are changing its value in recursive function. Only two W and n. So this will be the size of our matrix
```C++
int dp[n+1][w+1]
```

We will intialize the array with -1.
We can use **memset(dp,-1,sizeof(dp))** or for loop

**Code : **
```C++
int dp[102][1002]		// 102 and 1002 are maximum values of n and W
memset(dp,-1,sizeof(dp));
int knapsack(int wt[],int val[],int W,int n)
{
 if(n==0 || W==0)
 	return 0;
 if(dp[n][W]!=-1)
 	return dp[n][W];
 if(wt[n-1]<=W)
 	return dp[n][W] = max(val[n - 1] + knapsack(wt, val, W - wt[n - 1], n - 1), knapsack(wt, val, W, n - 1));
 else if(wt[n-1]>W)
 	return dp[n][W]=knapsack(wt,val,W,n-1);
}
```


**Converting memoization to top down approach : - **

In top down approach we will convert recursion to iterative.

**STEPS TO CHANGE MEMOIZATION TO TOP DOWN APPROACH : **
1. Intialization
2. Change recursive_function(recursive calls) to iterative.

**What value we will intialize and where ?**
We will see the recursive function base condition.
```C++
	if(n==0 || W==0)
		return 0;
```

As we can see when there will be n equal to 0 then we will mark zero . And when W equal to 0 then we will mark 0.
So in the matrix we will intialize first row and coloumn with 0 respectively. 

Equations of top down approch:
```C++
if(wt[n-1]<=W)
	t[n][w]=max(val[n-1]+t[n-1][W-wt[n-1]],t[n-1][w]);
else
	t[n][w]=t[n-1][w]
```

Now we will convert n,w into i,j

**Code : **
```C++
int dp[1000][1000];
int knapsack(int wt[],int val[],int W,int n)
{
	for(int i=0;i<n+1;i++)
	{
		dp[i][0]=0;
	}
	for(int i=0;i<W+1;i++)
	{
		dp[0][i]=0;
	}
	for(int i=1;i<n+1;i++)
	{
		for(int j=1;j<W+1;j++)
		{
			if(wt[n-1]<=j)
				dp[i][j]=max(val[i-1]+dp[i-1][W-wt[i-1]],dp[i-1][j]);
			else
				dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j];
		}
	}
}
```
