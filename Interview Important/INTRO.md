# INTRO

Thank you for allowing me to introduce myself. My name is Ashutosh Gupta. I am final year student at University of Petroleumn and Energy Studies Dehradun pursuing B.tech with majors in computer science with specialization of Cyber Security and Forensics. I invested my last three, 3.5years in developing my technical skills which includes programming in C++ and Python with C++ being the preferred programming language. And I am also familiar with concepts and subjects such  as OOPS, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks. So these all are my technical skills.
I also have a keen interest in web development and problem solving skill as well. And to enhance my web development skill I have made projects such as iNoteBook and CowinNotifier.
Recently I have completed my summer internship at TalentServe which is an EDTech Startup.
Apart from this I also participate in coding events on leetcode and geekforgeeks.
