# Software Development Life Cycle :


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. The process is associated with several models, each including a variety of tasks and activities.


### Why SDLC is important ?

1. SDLC ensures that at every stage of development, proper testing is done to balance and check all software. It also maintains a clear stage progression.
2. It allows team to plan well in advance to determine the costs and budget.



### Phases of SDLC :

**1. Planning :** Planning is the first stage of SDLC. It requires collecting the requirements, along with inputs from domain experts and stakeholders. It also ensures identifying any potential risks. Developers also conduct research and gain a thorough understanding of the customer’s demands. With a clear understanding of customer feedback, pros and cons, technology stacks being used and so on, planning helps lay a strong foundation for easy development of the product, its timeline and potential tests and risks associated with the final service.

**2. Requirement Analysis :** Most software development then proceeds to the creation of a Software Requirements Specification document. This will describe the features and specifications of the product or service that is being created. This document is shared with the stakeholders and business owners. They go over the document and may accept or reject it based on financial constraints, time limits or requirement changes. Once the final SRS is accepted, the project can proceed to the next stage of the software development life cycle.

**3. Design :** Once the Software Requirements Specification document has been finalised and approved, the product architects come together to create a Design Document Specification. This describes the features of the product in detail.This provides developers with everything they need to start working on the final product or service.

**4. Development and Implmentation :** This is the most important phase of SDLC. It takes up most of the time and resources. Developers have to pick the most appropriate coding language. This stage requires effective communication between members of the team and also between developers and QA testers, managers and clients. This is the foundation of a well-made product.

**5. Testing :** After the product has been developed, the SDLC moves to the testing phase. QA testers try to go over the code, run it through multiple use cases and find bugs and errors. Problems are returned to developers who rectify errors. This is an iterative process that continues until there are no more bugs or errors found.

**6. Deployment :** Once testing is done, the product is rolled out to markets or deployed. Deployment can be done all at once, or in batches.

**7. Maintenance :** Software development does not end with deployment. It is important to identify how the market responds to your software. Development teams can utilise the feedback and reaction of consumers to make reports on what needs to be improved and what the users like. This might include minor changes like a simpler or more intuitive interface, or major overhauls like entire features. Whatever the case, these can contribute to a better-upgraded version.


### Types of SDLC :

**Waterfall Model :** The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a **linear-sequential life cycle model**. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.

The Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development.

The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In this waterfall model, the phases do not overlap.
