# Tricks in DP



### To find the recurrence relations
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuff on that index
3. **If question says count all the ways** -> then sum up all stuffs
4. **If question says find minimum** -> minimum of all stuffs
5. **If question says find maximum** -> maximum of all stuffs


### Space Optimization
If there is a dp[index-1] or dp[index-2] then means it is confirmed that there will be a space optimization.
