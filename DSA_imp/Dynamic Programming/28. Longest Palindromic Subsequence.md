# Longest Palindromic Subsequence
#dp_on_strings 


Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in_ `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "bbbab"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cbbd"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".


### Approach 1 (Tabulation) :

**Intuition:**

Let us say that we are given the following string.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/t6krv5guCb_azO1o5-KhOPtzPK0_UR6HjFNlfFO3zoU959ub5xjmeLJHrJ99mSIrnFSjnpqCENMNMoIQfWBDeq_PlxveJ7qQLQJyj8Qi68jrR0zwlO4HL7ijPfaVlLxBaposh-xg)

The longest palindromic subsequence will be: “babcbab”.

What is special about this string is that it is **palindromic (equal to its reverse) and of the longest length.**

Now let us write the reverse of str next to it and please think about the highlighted characters.

If we look closely at the highlighted characters, they are nothing but the longest common subsequence of the two strings.

Now, we have taken the reverse of the string for the following two reasons:

-   The longest palindromic subsequence being a palindrome will remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
-   The length of the palindromic subsequence will also remain the same when the entire string is reversed.

From the above discussion we can conclude:

**The longest palindromic subsequence of a string is the longest common subsequence of the given string and its reverse.**


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string s,string t)
    {
        int n=s.length();
        int m=t.length();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1,vector<int>(m+1,0));
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=1;j<=m;j++)
            {
                if(s[i-1]==t[j-1])
                    dp[i][j]=1+dp[i-1][j-1];
                else
                    dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        string t=s;
        reverse(t.begin(),t.end());
        return longestCommonSubsequence(s,t);
    }
};
```
