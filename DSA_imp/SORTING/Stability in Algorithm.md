# Stability in Sorting Algorithms


## Stable Sort :
Stable sorting means if two values are same then they are placed in the same order as they are.
Suppose I want to sort this data : [ {5,"A"}, {8,"B"}, {3,"C", {5,"F"}}]
then the sorted array will be
[ {3,"C"}, {5,"A"}, {5,"F"}, {8,"B"}]

**Example of stable sorts :** 
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort


## UnStable Sort :
Unstable is just an opposite of Stable sort. Means it will change the order if the values are same.

**Example of UnStable Sort :**
1. Selection Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Heap Sort
