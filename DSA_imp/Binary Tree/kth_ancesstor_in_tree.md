# kth Ancesstor in a Tree

Given a binary tree of size  **N**, a **node** and a positive integer **k**., Your task is to complete the function **kthAncestor()**, the function should return the **kth** ancestor of the given node in the binary tree. If there does not exist any such ancestor then return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
     K = 2
     Node = 4
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
Since, K is 2 and node is 4, so we
first need to locate the node and
look k times its ancestors.
Here in this Case node 4 has 1 as his
2nd Ancestor aka the Root of the tree.
