# important points for BST

1. Inorder of BST is always sorted. Suppose you have preorder,postorder then you can find inorder by sorting preorder or postorder.
	>
	**preorder** = [8,5,1,7,10,12]
	**inorder** =[1,5,7,8,10,12]
	
	
2. If BST if root value is 9 then left subtree will not have value grater than 9 and right subtree will not have less than 9
