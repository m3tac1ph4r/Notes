# Comments

There are two type of comments in C++

1. **One line comment:**
   You can comment the line like this
   ```cpp
   //comment
   int a=10; //integer variable
   ```
2. **Paragraph comment:**
   You can full paragraph as comment
   > /\*\*/

# Input/Output in C++

```cpp
cout<<"Hey boi!"
```

The identifier **cout** is actually an object. It is predefined to correspond to the standard output stream.

The operator **<<** is called the insertion or put to operator. It directs the content of the variable on its right to the object on its left.

To receive input through the keyboard an identifier called **cin** is used. The >> is the extraction or get from operator. It takes the value from the stream obect on its left and places it in the variable on its right.

Here is a program that puts cout and cin to work

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char str[40];
int m1,m2,m3,avg;
cout<<"Enter your name";
cin>>str;
cout<<"Enter marks in three subjects";
cin>>m1>>m2>>m3;
avg=(m1+m2+m3)/3;
cout<<"Your name is "<<str<<endl;
cout<<"And your average marks are "<<avg<<endl;
return 0;
}
```

## Meaning of using namespace std;

A namespace is nothing but a collection of identifiers(variable names and some other types of names) . For example all identifiers in the C++ standard library belong to a namespace called **std** .
There are two ways to refer to a specific identifier that belonfs to a namespace.
These are:

1. Use the **using** statement at the beginning of the program as we have done in our program
2. Prefix the identifier with the name of the namespace followed by two colons. An example of this is shown below:
   _std::cout<<"Enter your name"_

   # Inferring Types

   We need to use **auto** as the type specifier for the variable as shown below.

   ```cpp
   auto age1=32;
   auto age2=age1;
   ```

   Since 32 is an **int**,type assumed for age1 will be **int**. Similarly since **age1** is **int** and it is being assigned to **age2**,age2 is also assumed to be an **int**.

   ```cpp
   char ch;
   decltype (ch)dh;
   ```

   Here type of **dh** will be same as type of **ch**
   **auto** and **decltype** are features that have been recently added to the language.

# structure

Structure is a user-defined data type in C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.
**How to create a structure?**
The _struct_ keyword is used to create a structure. The general syntax to create a structure is :

```cpp
struct stu
{
char name[10];
int id[5];
float salary;
};
```

**How to declare structure variable?**

```cpp
struct Point
{
int x=50;
int y=100;
};
int main()
{
struct Point p1; // or Point p1;
cout<<"x="<<p1.x<<endl;
cout<<"y="<<p1.y<<endl;
return 0;
}
```

We can declare values to the struct members like this also:

```cpp
struct Point
{
int x,y;
};
int main()
{
struct Point p1={100,50};
cout<<"x="<<p1.x<<endl;
cout<<"y="<<p1.y<<endl;
return 0;
}
```

**Array of Structures:**

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
struct Point
{
int x,y;
};
int main()
{
struct Point arr[10];
arr[0].x=20;
arr[0].y=10;
return 0;
}
```

# Union

A union is a type of structure that can be used where the amount of memory used is a key factor.

1. Simlarly to the structure the union can contain different types of data types.
2. This is most useful when the type of data being passed through funtion is unknown, using a union which contains all possible data types can remedy this problem.
3. It is declared by using keyword "union"

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
union check
{
int a;
char b;
float c;
};
int main()
{
union U1,U2,U3;
U1.a=34;
U2.b='C';
U3.c=56.82;
}
```

# The :: Operator

:: is the scope resolution operator. It resolves a dispute in scope when local and global variables exist with same names.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int num=10;
int main()
{
int num=15;
cout<<"Local Num= "<<num<<endl;
cout<<"Global Num= "<<::num<<endl;
::num=50;
cout<<"Updated Global Num= "<<::num<<endl;
return 0;
}
```

**OUTPUT**

> Local Num= 15
> Global Num= 10
> Updated Global Num= 50
