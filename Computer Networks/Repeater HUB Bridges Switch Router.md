# Repeater (Physical Layer):
A repeater is implemented in computer networks **to expand the coverage area of the network, repropagate a weak or broken signal and or service remote nodes**. Repeaters amplify the received/input signal to a higher frequency domain so that it is reusable, scalable and available.


# HUB(Physical Layer) :

* Multiport Repeater
* Forwarding
* No filtering

A network hub is **a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernet-based device connected to it**. A hub is less sophisticated than a switch, the latter of which can isolate data transmissions to specific devices. Network hubs are best suited for small, simple local area network (LAN) environments.



# Bridges (Physical Layer and Data Link layer) :

* Connect two different LAN's
* Forwarding
* Filtering
* Collision Domain will not occur. Because bridges have buffer where it will store the packets from different source.

A bridge is **a network device that connects multiple LANs (local area networks) together to form a larger LAN**.


# Switch (Data Link Layer) :
They **connect multiple devices, such as computers, wireless access points, printers, and servers; on the same network within a building or campus**. A switch enables connected devices to share information and talk to each other.

* Multiport Bridge
* Collision Domain is 0
