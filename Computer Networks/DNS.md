# Domain Name System (DNS) :

1. It is a naming system for all the resources over the internet which includes physical nodes and application. It is used to locate resources easily over a network.
2. DNS is an internet which maps the domain names to their associated IP addresses.
3. Without DNS, users must know the IP address of the web page that you wanted to access.


**Working of DNS :**
If you want to visit the website of "shaurya", then the user will type "http://www.shaurya.com" into the address bar of the web browser. Once the domain name is entered, then the domain name system will translate the domain name into the IP address which can be easily interpreted by the computer. Using the IP adress, the computer can locate the web page requested by the user.


**DNS Forwarder :** A forwarder is used with a DNS server when it receives DNS queries that cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards those requests to external DNS servers for resolution. A DNS server which is configured as a forwarder will behave differently than the DNS server which is not configured as a forwarder.


**SMTP Protocol :** SMTP is the **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**. SMTP sets the rule for communication between servers. This set of rules helps the software to transmit the emails over the internet. It supports both End-to-End  and Store-and-Forward methods. It is in always-listening mode on port 25.
