# Combine Two Tables

![[2.1.png]]

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the `Person` table. If the address of a `personId` is not present in the `Address` table, report `null` instead.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Explanation:** 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.


### Query

```sql
SELECT firstName,lastName,city,state from person
LEFT JOIN address
ON person.personId=address.personId;
```
