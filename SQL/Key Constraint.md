# SQL Constraint


**NOT NULL :** This constraint tells that we cannot store a null value in a column. That is, if a column is specified as NOT NULL then we will not be able to store null in this particular column any more. 

**UNIQUE :** This constraint when specified with a column, tells that all the values in the column must be unique. That is, the values in any row of a column must not be repeated.

**PRIMARY KEY :** A primary key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a table. And this constraint is used to specify a field in a table as primary key.  

**FOREIGN KEY :** A Foreign key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a another table. And this constraint is used to specify a field as Foreign key.  

**CHECK :** This constraint helps to validate the values of a column to meet a particular condition. That is, it helps to ensure that the value stored in a column meets a specific condition.  

**DEFAULT :** This constraint specifies a default value for the column when no value is specified by the user.
